#### Sessions and Cookies

Recall that HTTP servers need to be able to recognize clients from one another. They do this through sessions and cookies.

Answer the following questions about sessions and cookies:

    ```HTTP
    GET /cart HTTP/1.1
    Host: www.example.org
    Cookie: cart=Bob
    'Connection: keep-alive'
    ```

#### Example HTTP Requests and Responses

23.    Does this response have a user session associated to it?
       * Yes SessionID=5

24.    What kind of content is likely to be in the [page content] response body?
       * Detail of the page configuration
       
25.    If your class covered security headers, what security request headers have been included?
       * Strict-Transport-Security:  max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains   
         
#### Monoliths and Microservices

Answer the following questions about monoliths and microservices:

       * Services

27.    What is a service that writes to a database and communicates to other services?
       * APIs

28.    What type of underlying technology allows for microservices to become scalable and have redundancy?

#### Deploying and Testing a Container Set

Answer the following questions about multi-container deployment:

29.    What tool can be used to deploy multiple containers at once?
       * Docker

30.    What kind of file format is required for us to deploy a container set?
       * .yml Yaml format
#### Databases

31.    Which type of SQL query would we use to see all of the information within a table called `customers`?
       * SELECT column_name 
         FROM customers; 
  
32.    Which type of SQL query would we use to enter new data into a table? (You don't need a full query, just the first part of the statement.)
       * INSERT INTO table_name (column_1, column_2, column_3) 
         VALUES (value_1, 'value_2', value_3);

33.    Why would we never run `DELETE FROM <table-name>;` by itself?
       * It will delete the entire table there is no select statement.
